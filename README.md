# Battery Status

### [Try it!](https://lukewestby.github.io/battery-status/example)

This package helps you find out information about the user's battery life if
it is available through the browser. This will let you do things like control
the rate at which animations or network polling is performed to preserve the
user's battery life and account for reduced CPU performance at low power levels.

This package is backed by the [Battery Status
API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Battery_Status_API)
